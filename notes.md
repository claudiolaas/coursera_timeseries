Week 1 
- time series = stochastic process
- inferences = confidence intervals, hypothesis tests
- assumptions for linear regression: 
    - errors are normally distributed
    - have the same variance(homoscedastic)
    - are unrelated to eachother
- Asses Residuals: 
    - "histogram of residuals" only valid if you have lots of data points
    - QQ-Plot --> look for **systematic** deviations from the straight line
    - plot residuals over time --> inspect for patterns
